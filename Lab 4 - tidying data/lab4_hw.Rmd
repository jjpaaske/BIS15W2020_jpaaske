## Instructions
Answer the following questions and complete the exercises in RMarkdown. Please embed all of your code and push your final work to your repository. Your final lab report should be organized, clean, and run free from errors. Remember, you must remove any `#` for included code chunks to run.  

## Load the tidyverse
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

For this assignment we are going to work with a large dataset from the [United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization](http://www.fao.org/about/en/) on world fisheries. First, load the data.  

1. Load the data `FAO_1950to2012_111914.csv` as a new object titled `fisheries`.

```{r}
fisheries <- readr::read_csv("data/FAO_1950to2012_111914.csv") %>% 
  #I'm not sure what this code did, it doesn't seem to have changed anything in the dataframe and isn't necessary to use the data
  mutate_all(~str_replace_all(., " F", "")) %>%
  mutate_all(str_trim) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(starts_with("19",)), ~str_replace_all(., " ", "")) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(starts_with("2")), ~str_replace_all(., " ", ""))
```

2. What are the names of the columns? Do you see any potential problems with the column names?

```{r}
colnames(fisheries)
#option names()
```

Measure is slightly ambiguous, and the columns from 1950 to 2012 are variables. 

3. What is the structure of the data? Show the classes of each variable.
```{r}
sapply(fisheries, class)
#option gimpse()
```

4. Think about the classes. Will any present problems? Make any changes you think are necessary below.

The columns with years should not be characters, but numerics, and the rest should be a factors. 
##Nice, this works well for changing many columns
```{r}
fisheries <- fisheries %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(starts_with("19")), as.numeric) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(starts_with("2")), as.numeric) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)
  

sapply(fisheries, class)
```

5. How many countries are represented in the data? Provide a count.
```{r}
nlevels(fisheries$Country)
```

6. What are the names of the countries?
```{r}
levels(fisheries$Country)
```


7. Use `rename()` to rename the columns and make them easier to use. The new column names should be:  
+ country
+ commname
+ ASFIS_sciname
+ ASFIS_spcode
+ ISSCAAP_spgroup
+ ISSCAAP_spgroupname
+ FAO_area
+ unit
##Formatting the code this way makes it more readable, and allows you to see inconsistancies in your punctuation
```{r}
fisheries <- fisheries %>% 
  rename(country = 'Country', 
         commname = 'Common name', 
         ASFIS_sciname = 'ASFIS species name', 
         ASFIS_spcode = 'ASFIS species#', 
         ISSCAAP_spgroupname = 'ISSCAAP taxonomic group', 
         ISSCAAP_spgroup = 'ISSCAAP group#', 
         FAO_area = 'FAO major fishing area', 
         unit = 'Measure')
```

8. Are these data tidy? Why or why not, and, how do you know? Use the appropriate pivot function to tidy the data. Remove the NA's. Put the tidy data frame into a new object `fisheries_tidy`. 

These data are not tidy, because the column names including years are data. 
```{r}
fisheries_tidy <- fisheries %>% 
  pivot_longer(-c(country, commname, ASFIS_spcode, ASFIS_sciname, ISSCAAP_spgroupname, ISSCAAP_spgroup, FAO_area, unit), 
               names_to = "year",
               values_to = "catch")
fisheries_tidy
```

9. Refocus the data only to include country, ISSCAAP_spgroupname, ASFIS_spcode, ASFIS_sciname, year, and catch.
```{r}
#you already made years numeric above
fisheries_tidy2 <- fisheries_tidy %>% 
  select(country, ISSCAAP_spgroupname, ISSCAAP_spgroup, ASFIS_spcode, ASFIS_sciname, year, catch) %>% 
  #mutate_at(vars(year), as.numeric)
```

10. Re-check the classes of `fisheries_tidy2`. Notice that "catch" is shown as a character! This is a problem because we will want to treat it as a numeric. How will you deal with this?
```{r}
lapply(fisheries_tidy2, class)
```
I already changed the values of catch to numerics earlier on in the homework. 

11. Based on the ASFIS_spcode, how many distinct taxa were caught as part of these data?

```{r}
nlevels(fisheries_tidy2$ASFIS_spcode)
```
1553 distinct taxa were caught as part of this data.

##use n_distinct to give you the number of distinct taxa
```{r}
#fisheries_tidy2 %>% 
  #summarize(n_taxa=n_distinct(ASFIS_spcode))
```

12. Which country had the largest overall catch in the year 2000?
```{r}
fisheries_tidy2 %>% 
  filter(year == 2000) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarize(catch = sum(catch, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(catch))
  
```
China had the largest overal catch of 12695472 tonnes in the year 2000.

13. Which country caught the most sardines (_Sardina_) between the years 1990-2000?
```{r}
fisheries_tidy2 %>% 
  select(country, catch, year, ASFIS_sciname) %>%
  filter(str_detect(ASFIS_sciname, "Sardina")) %>% 
  filter(year <= 2000 & year >= 1990) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarize(catch = sum(catch, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(catch, by.group = TRUE))

```
Morocco had the largest catch of 4785190 tonnes. 

14. Which five countries caught the most cephalopods between 2008-2012?
```{r}
fisheries_tidy2 %>% 
  filter(str_detect(ISSCAAP_spgroupname, "Squids")) %>% 
  filter(year <= 2012 & year >= 2008) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarize(catch = sum(catch, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(catch, by.group = TRUE))
```
China caught the most cephalopods betwen 2008-2012. 

15. Given the top five countries from question 14 above, which species was the highest catch total? The lowest?
```{r}
fisheries_tidy2 %>% 
  filter(str_detect(ISSCAAP_spgroupname, "Squids")) %>% 
  filter(year <= 2012 & year >= 2008) %>% 
  group_by(ASFIS_sciname) %>% 
  summarize(catch_total=sum(catch, na.rm=T)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(catch_total))
```
Dosidicus gigas had the highest catch total of 4211138 tons. 

```{r}
fisheries_tidy2 %>% 
  filter(str_detect(ISSCAAP_spgroupname, "Squids")) %>% 
  filter(year <= 2012 & year >= 2008) %>% 
  group_by(ASFIS_sciname) %>% 
  summarize(catch_total=sum(catch, na.rm=T)) %>% 
  arrange(catch_total)
```
The species with the lowest catch total is Todarodes filippovae with 1 ton (excluding fish with 0 tonnes) 

16. In some cases, the taxonomy of the fish being caught is unclear. Make a new data frame called `coastal_fish` that shows the taxonomic composition of "Miscellaneous coastal fishes" within the ISSCAAP_spgroupname column.
```{r}
coastal_fish <- fisheries_tidy2 %>% 
  filter(ISSCAAP_spgroupname == 'Miscellaneous coastal fishes')
coastal_fish
```

17. Use the data to do at least one exploratory analysis of your choice. What can you learn?

I am going to explore which country caught the most variety of coastal fish. 
```{r}
coastal_fish %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarize(types_of_fish = n_distinct(ASFIS_sciname)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(types_of_fish))
```
The United States of America caught the most variety of coastal fish with Saudi Arabia coming in second.
