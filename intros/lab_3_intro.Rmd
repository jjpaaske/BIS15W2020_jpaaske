## Setup
1. Login to the lab computer.  
2. Open Github Desktop (it should be pre-installed) and login.  
3. Clone your repository to the desktop or somewhere convenient to access.  
4. Navigate to github.com and login.  
5. Go to the class repository `BIS15-W20-DataScienceBiologists`, click the `Clone or download` button then `Download zip` to the desktop.  
6. Copy the files for today's lab from the class repository and paste them into **your** repository.  
7. Open today's lab in RStudio.  

## Updates
- Make sure you have the latest version of R installed.  
- Make sure you have the latest version of RStudio installed.  
- Updates to R or RStudio require re-installation of packages.  

## Homework
- Take 5 minutes or so to double check that your homework is complete and uploaded.
- Suggestion: have a lab partner have a look at your repository on github.com. 

## Mini-Review from last time
1. What is your workflow? Where do you go when you get stuck?  
2. How is a data matrix different than a vector?  
3. What are the advantages of data frames?  

## RMarkdown
- Focus on generating crystal clear, organized reports.  
- Some new syntax, tips, and tricks.

## Base R vs. tidyverse
- You have been learning "base R coding".
- It is not intuitive, but can be helpful.
- Keeping track of data classes and understanding vectors is essential.  
- Tidyverse is designed to be more intuitive.

## Tidyverse  
- A set of connected packages united by common, intuitive language.
